# Platformer-Game

Currently a working title, the game is intended to be a puzzle game, where your character (the cube) will change color to the color it touches, gaining that color's properties. The point of the game is actually to be worse for colorblind people and eventually, I want to add difficulties that make other people see the colors how colorblind people see them, up to the point of the entire game being greyscale or just grey.
